            <p>
               As a full-stack developer, I built a large-scale feature for a multi-trillion dollar
               bank customer that saved over 60 hours of engineering time and over 100 hours of
               customer service time per year.
            </p>
            <p>
               I also contributed to setting up the standards and practices for a new UI library
               implementation, developed a feature to streamline the data entry process, and created
               and optimized back-end processes. Finally, I implemented repository-wide linting and
               code formatting to ensure adherence to code standards and best practices.
